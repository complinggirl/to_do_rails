# to_do_rails

A completed project (though the UI is clearly in dire need of attention). Add new tasks, and they appear in a list on the left. Complete a task and it appears in a list on the right. As is usual with rails newbies, I spent a lot of time over-thinking this. Rails magic does it every time.
Ideally, it should allow you to create new lists and edit both lists and tasks but time was pressing (bootcamp programming mode)
To use, clone to desktop. start postgresql, rake db:create, rake db: migrate and go see the awesomeness in your browser at localhost:3000
